# Docmosis Render Client

Welcome to the Docmosis client render library. This library makes it
easy to invoke renders using Docmosis web service end points (such as
the public Docmosis Cloud Services).

The Docmosis render service can:
  - merge data into DOC or ODT templates
  - produce PDF, DOC, RTF, ODT output
  - stream the resulting document back, email it, store it in the
    cloud or any combination. You can even stream, say a PDF whilst
    emailing a DOC in the single request.
  - the template features are many including:
    - text insertion anywhere (headers, footers, body, text boxes, tables)
    - image insertion (headers, footers, body, tables)
    - table expansion and manipulation
    - content stripping / repetition
    - hyperlinking
    - and many more features

You require Java 1.5 or later.

Please look at the sample code in the "samples" directory for some
example code to get started. More information about rendering
documents can be found in the Web Services Guide and the Template
Guide in the Docmosis support site
